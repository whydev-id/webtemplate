# My Personal Website Design

A custom-built personal website using a raw approach, with no frameworks or libraries.

## About

This website is a personal project that showcases my skills in web development. It's built from scratch using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Features

* Custom-designed layout and user interface
* Responsive design for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices
* Minimalistic design for fast loading times

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* No frameworks

## Structure

The website is structured into the following directories:

* `index.html`: The main entry point of the website
* `/assets`: Contains all assets used for the website
	+ `/css`: Stylesheets for layout and design
	+ `/js`: JavaScript files for interactive elements
	+ `/images`: Image assets used for the website
	+ `/fonts`: Font files used in the website
	+ `/scss`: SCSS files for development styling

## Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Sass

## Steps:
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Compile SASS `npm run compile-scss`
- Start the development server `npm run start`
- Access your application, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

### Explanation:
- The compile-scss script compiles SASS files into compressed CSS.
- The start script starts a simple HTTP server for serving your files.
